# Arithmetic-arranger.py

My job was to create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. 
The function should optionally take a second argument.
When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
The files main.py and test_module.py were already assigned and the TODO section was located in arithmetic_arrange.py
To solve this task, I used the regular expression library, with the help of which I solved the character problem, because the task only requires "+" and "-" operations.
